* Components

In an attempt to keep things simple, there are only three basic components of a note file. There is the raw text of the note, a header (which is the name of the note, and has properties), and links amid the raw text. Sometimes links are ephemeral, in that you add them and then run a command to execute the action the link points to, and sometimes they're persistent.
